# Assignment 2

This is my set of answers to Assignment 2: 

## Print Exercise 
No, no variables show up in the Variable editor after running the python script. Only the individual letters are printed. 

## Operation Exercises
1. Yes, python outputs the same values for both integer and float format.
```
print(5/2)
print(5.0/2.0)
```

2. The modulo operator returns the remainder of a division.
```
print(5.0%2.0)
print(6%3)
```

3. ** is the Exponentiation operator, which raises the first number to the power of the second number. 5**2 is same as 5<sup>^2</sup>. 
```
print(5.0**2.0)
print(6**3)
```
// is the floor division operator. The difference between / (division) operator and this operator is that, floor division will round down the result to the nearest integer/whole number instead of a float. 
``` 
print(5.0//2.0)
print(6//3)
```
4. Yes. Python follows the order of operations. 

## Variable Exercises
- No variables show up in the variable editor 
- Python has no problem with two or more different variables having the same value
- No, changing the value of letterX did not change the value of the other variables
- Yes, changing the value of letter1 after letterX=letter1 was assigned, changes the value of letterX. This shows that Python returns the reassigned value in the variable. 

## Boolean Exercises
1 and 1.0 are equivalent. "1" and "1.0" are not equivalent because they are not identical strings. "1.0" has a float value while "1" is only an integer. 
Yes, 5 and 3+2 are equivalent, as the Boolean returns True.

## List Exercises
- Yes, oddlist became a variable. 
- No error was found
- The length of the list is 5
- The oddlist is a list type variable
- Yes, intlist prints out all integers between 0 and 100, exluding the integers 0 and 100. 

## Dictionary Exercises
- The "type" function returns that it is a dictionary type.
- The length of about_me is 4. Python determines the length of a dictionary by counting the number of variables assigned. 

## Array Exercises
1. The printed array returns all the values in float format, even the integer values. 
2. The array takes in the mixed values and returns all the values in string format.
