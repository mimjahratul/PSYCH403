### Description:
The experiment is a reaction based memory task that displays a list of stimuli (words) to the participant and asks them to remember as many stimuli as they can. After the list of stimuli has been displayed, the participant is asked to enter the stimuli they remember, separated by commas. The experiment records the participant's responses and  reaction times and saves them to two CSV files respectively. 

This experiment is designed to study memory and the ability to recall information from memory. By measuring the number of stimuli that participants can remember, researchers can assess the effectiveness of different memory strategies, such as rehearsal or visualization, and identify factors that affect memory performance, such as age or gender. 

The experiment also records the reaction time for each stimulus, which can be used to study the speed of memory processes, such as encoding and retrieval. This can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of memory and the factors that influence them.

Overall, this experiment can help researchers better understand memory and its underlying processes, which can have practical applications in fields such as education and healthcare.
